# Architecture Decisions

## 2026-09-12 - Chose Django + DRF over FastAPI for the core backend
**Why:** Team's Python familiarity, and the need for an admin panel + ORM + built-in auth given the number of entities in this system.
**Alternatives considered:** FastAPI — faster and more "modern" for pure APIs, but would have required building admin tooling, auth, and ORM integration from scratch.

## 2026-09-12 - Chose a modular monolith (Django apps per domain) over microservices
**Why:** Unified backend requirement across MindCare Web and MindCare App, plus the FYP timeline doesn't allow for the operational overhead of running and deploying separate services.
**Alternatives considered:** Microservices per domain (accounts, appointments, payments, etc.) — better long-term scalability and isolation, but far too much infrastructure and deployment complexity for the timeline.

## 2026-09-12 - Kept AI inference as a separate FastAPI service, not merged into the Django monolith
**Why:** Different runtime needs (AI/ML dependencies vs. web framework dependencies) and a clean API boundary between the two services.
**Alternatives considered:** Running inference inside the Django process — simpler deployment, but couples unrelated dependency sets and runtime characteristics together.

## 2026-09-12 - Chose service/selector pattern over strict hexagonal Clean Architecture
**Why:** Pragmatic tradeoff that fits Django's ORM-centric style and avoids repository-interface boilerplate that fights the framework.
**Alternatives considered:** Hexagonal/Clean Architecture with repository interfaces — more testable/portable in theory, but adds significant boilerplate for a Django project of this size and timeline.

## 2026-09-12 - Chose PostgreSQL via Supabase/Neon, Redis via Redis Cloud, hosting via Render
**Why:** Free-tier student budget — these providers offer usable free tiers for a project at FYP scale.
**Alternatives considered:** Self-hosted Postgres/Redis on a VPS — more control, but more setup/maintenance burden and no free tier.

## 2026-09-15 - Auth events logged via structured logging, not a DB-backed audit trail (for now)
**Why:** `core/audit.py` is explicitly not a Django app (see @architecture.md), so it
can't own a model/migration on its own, and building a dedicated `apps/audit` app was
judged out of scope for the auth/RBAC foundation task. Auth events (login, failed
login, logout, token refresh, register) are emitted as structured JSON log lines via
a dedicated `mindcare.audit` logger instead.
**Alternatives considered:** A new `apps/audit` app with a DB-backed `AuditLog` model,
queryable for a future admin security dashboard — deferred to a later task once
there's an actual consumer (e.g. an admin-facing audit view) that needs it queryable
rather than just captured.

## 2026-09-15 - Deferred the super-admin promote/demote workflow; only the `is_super_admin` field ships now
**Why:** The auth/RBAC foundation task needed a bootstrap mechanism for the system's
first super-admin before any admin-management endpoints exist, so `User` gets an
`is_super_admin` boolean (default `False`) and `create_superuser()` sets it `True`.
The actual workflow — an existing super-admin creating sub-admin accounts, promoting
a sub-admin to super-admin, a super-admin demoting themselves, and the invariant that
at least one super-admin must always exist (checked atomically to avoid a race) — is
deferred to the same future admin-management task that already owns the
admin-approval-workflow endpoints (see the auth/RBAC design doc's Section 2 non-goals,
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-15-auth-rbac-design.md`).
**Alternatives considered:** Building the full promote/demote workflow now — rejected
as out of scope; the auth/RBAC task's job is the foundation (the field), not the
admin-management feature built on top of it.
