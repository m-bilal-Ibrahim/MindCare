# Module tracker

Status of every bullet in the official module list ([../modules.md](../modules.md)),
per component. Built from the 2026-10-08 audit ([2026-10-08-status.md](2026-10-08-status.md))
and checked against `main` at `a295f11`. **Update this file at the end of every module.**

Status values: **done** (works end to end on real data) · **partial** (some of the
bullet works; the note says what's missing) · **mock only** (screens exist with
hardcoded data, no backend calls) · **not started** · **—** (that component has no
role in the bullet).

The Web is the psychologist/admin client; the App is the patient client. "Branch"
means the work sits on an unmerged branch.

Last updated: 2026-10-10 (input-validation-hardening, backend part). Re-checked against
`origin` on 2026-10-10: no frontend changes have been pushed since 2026-10-08.
