# Module Reference

This is a running technical reference of the backend codebase, built up incrementally
as features are implemented. For every file that carries logic (services, selectors,
API views, tasks, etc.) it records:

- the file and the function/class in it
- what that function/class does
- the API endpoint it powers, if any
- which frontend (MindCare Web, MindCare App, or neither) consumes it

This file is not architecture documentation — see @architecture.md for that. Its
purpose is to give whoever writes the final FYP project documentation a complete,
accurate inventory of the codebase to work from, without having to re-derive it from
the source at the end of the project. It is kept up to date as we go rather than
reconstructed later, per the rule in @../CLAUDE.md.

## How to add an entry

Append a row to the relevant app's table below (add a new `### apps/<app_name>`
section, in alphabetical order, if one doesn't exist yet) whenever you implement a
new service, selector, or API endpoint. Keep entries one row per function/class.

| File | Function / Class | Purpose | API Endpoint | Frontend Consumer |
|------|-------------------|---------|--------------|--------------------|
| _example:_ `apps/accounts/services.py` | `register_patient()` | Creates a `User` + `PatientProfile` in one transaction, sends verification email | `POST /api/v1/accounts/register/` | MindCare Web, MindCare App |

### apps/accounts

| File | Function / Class | Purpose | API Endpoint | Frontend Consumer |
|------|-------------------|---------|--------------|--------------------|
| `apps/accounts/models.py` | `User` | Custom auth user model: email login, `role`, `approval_status`, `is_super_admin` | — | MindCare Web, MindCare App |
| `apps/accounts/services.py` | `register_user()` | Creates a `User` with the role-appropriate default `approval_status`, logs a `register` audit event | `POST /api/v1/accounts/register/` | MindCare Web, MindCare App |
| `apps/accounts/services.py` | `authenticate_and_check_approval()` | Authenticates credentials and enforces the `approval_status` gate for psychologist/NGO accounts | `POST /api/v1/accounts/login/` | MindCare Web, MindCare App |
| `apps/accounts/services.py` | `record_token_refresh()` | Logs a `token_refresh` audit event | `POST /api/v1/accounts/refresh/` | MindCare Web, MindCare App |
| `apps/accounts/services.py` | `record_logout()` | Logs a `logout` audit event | `POST /api/v1/accounts/logout/` | MindCare Web, MindCare App |
| `apps/accounts/selectors.py` | `get_user_from_refresh_token()` | Decodes a refresh token and looks up its owning user | — | MindCare Web, MindCare App |
| `apps/accounts/api/views.py` | `RegisterView` | Public registration for patient/psychologist/NGO roles (never admin) | `POST /api/v1/accounts/register/` | MindCare Web, MindCare App |
| `apps/accounts/api/views.py` | `LoginView` | JWT login; embeds `role` claim; blocks pending/rejected accounts; throttled | `POST /api/v1/accounts/login/` | MindCare Web, MindCare App |
| `apps/accounts/api/views.py` | `RefreshView` | Rotates JWT refresh tokens, blacklists the token just used | `POST /api/v1/accounts/refresh/` | MindCare Web, MindCare App |
| `apps/accounts/api/views.py` | `LogoutView` | Blacklists the presented refresh token | `POST /api/v1/accounts/logout/` | MindCare Web, MindCare App |

### core/ (shared, non-app modules)

| File | Function / Class | Purpose | API Endpoint | Frontend Consumer |
|------|-------------------|---------|--------------|--------------------|
| `core/permissions.py` | `IsPatient`, `IsPsychologist`, `IsAdmin`, `IsNGO` | Role-level DRF permission classes | — | MindCare Web, MindCare App |
| `core/permissions.py` | `IsOwnerOfObject` | Reusable object-level ownership permission base class, for future apps to subclass | — | (foundation for future apps) |
| `core/audit.py` | `log_auth_event()` | Emits structured, PHI-free JSON audit log lines for auth events | — | neither (internal) |

<!-- Add new `### apps/<app_name>` sections below as modules are implemented. -->
