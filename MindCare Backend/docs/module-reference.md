# Module Reference

This is a running technical reference of the backend codebase, built up incrementally
as features are implemented. For every file that carries logic (services, selectors,
API views, tasks, etc.) it records:

- the file and the function/class in it
- what that function/class does
- the API endpoint it powers, if any
- which frontend (MindCare Web, MindCare App, or neither) consumes it

This file is not architecture documentation — see @architecture.md for that. Its
purpose is to give whoever writes the final FYP project documentation a complete,
accurate inventory of the codebase to work from, without having to re-derive it from
the source at the end of the project. It is kept up to date as we go rather than
reconstructed later, per the rule in @../CLAUDE.md.

## How to add an entry

Append a row to the relevant app's table below (add a new `### apps/<app_name>`
section, in alphabetical order, if one doesn't exist yet) whenever you implement a
new service, selector, or API endpoint. Keep entries one row per function/class.

| File | Function / Class | Purpose | API Endpoint | Frontend Consumer |
|------|-------------------|---------|--------------|--------------------|
| _example:_ `apps/accounts/services.py` | `register_patient()` | Creates a `User` + `PatientProfile` in one transaction, sends verification email | `POST /api/v1/accounts/register/` | MindCare Web, MindCare App |

### apps/accounts

| File | Function / Class | Purpose | API Endpoint | Frontend Consumer |
|------|-------------------|---------|--------------|--------------------|
| `apps/accounts/models.py` | `User` | Custom auth user model: email login, `role`, `approval_status`, `is_super_admin`, `adult_confirmed_at` (18+ declaration timestamp) | — | MindCare Web, MindCare App |
| `apps/accounts/models.py` | `User.last_active_at` | Last activity, psychologists only (shown as a band) | — | MindCare App |
| `apps/accounts/services.py` | `register_user()` | Requires the 18+ declaration (stamps `adult_confirmed_at`), creates `User` + role profile in one transaction via `PROFILE_CREATORS` (no signals), logs a `register` audit event only on success | `POST /api/v1/accounts/register/` | MindCare Web, MindCare App |

| `core/choices.py` | `Gender` | Shared gender choices for patient/psychologist profiles | — | MindCare Web, MindCare App |
| `core/serializers.py` | `RejectUnknownFieldsMixin` | Makes serializers reject undeclared keys (e.g. `pseudonym`) with a 400; checked in `to_internal_value`, so nested and `many=True` children (e.g. each NGO `service_areas` item) are covered too | — | neither (internal) |
| `core/serializers.py` | `StrictTrueField` | Custom DRF field that accepts **only** the JSON boolean `true`, rejecting coerced truthy values like `"true"`, `1`, `"yes"` (used for legal declarations like the 18+ confirmation); documented as a boolean in the OpenAPI schema | — | neither (internal) |
| `core/pagination.py` | `StandardPagination` | Shared page-number pagination: 20 per page by default, `page_size` query param capped at 50 | all paginated list endpoints | MindCare Web, MindCare App |
| `core/audit.py` | `log_identity_reveal()` | Logs `identity_reveal` (viewer id, patient id only) when an admin resolves a private patient's real name | — | neither (internal) |
| `core/audit.py` | `log_relationship_event()` | Relationship state changes (requested/cancelled/accepted/declined/expired/ended) with relationship id, actor id/role and reason only | — | neither (internal) |

### config/ (project settings)

| File | Function / Class | Purpose | API Endpoint | Frontend Consumer |
|------|-------------------|---------|--------------|--------------------|
| `config/settings/base.py`, `dev.py`, `prod.py` | `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS`, `corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware` | CORS configured via `django-cors-headers` (`requirements/base.txt`, 4.9.0). `base.py`/`prod.py` allow the deployed MindCare Web origin (`https://mind-care-web-seven.vercel.app`; pinned explicitly in `prod.py`) plus any origins in the `CORS_EXTRA_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var (comma-separated, unset by default); `dev.py` adds the Vite dev server (`http://localhost:5173`) and the Flutter web dev server (`http://localhost:5000`). `CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS=False` because auth is JWT bearer tokens in the `Authorization` header, not cookies. Middleware sits above `CommonMiddleware` | all `/api/v1/` endpoints | MindCare Web |
| `manage.py` | `main()` | `manage.py test` forces `config.settings.test` (guarded, local-only DB) so the Django test runner can never run against the `.env` production `DATABASE_URL` | — | neither (tooling) |
| `apps/*/api/views.py` | `extend_schema` annotations | OpenAPI request/response schema for every Phase 2 and Phase 3 endpoint (register documents the per-role `profile` shape) | `/api/schema/`, `/api/docs/` | MindCare Web, MindCare App |
