"""Write-path logic for the AI gateway.

Forwards a psychologist-entered set of features to the AI service's
/patient-summary and returns its prediction, estimated severity tier and
recommendation bundle. Nothing is stored and the features are never logged: they are health
data, and no health data is stored before the Phase 5 audit trail (see
docs/decisions.md, 2026-10-07). Who may call this is decided by the view's
permissions (approved, active psychologists only): the prediction is decision
support for a psychologist and never goes to a patient directly.
